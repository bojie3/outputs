Ahem I I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher . I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology because I I want to my psychology office and help people .
I consider ghat is more convenient to dive a czt because you vrry on mirs things in your own car rather than travelling by car .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car , I used to use the bus to go to school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , these children are n't necessary when you have children in sports . At that moment you realize the importajce of a public tour .
Fependkng on the development duration to FHS place , the mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
Gut Geneeakly speakumg , travelling by car is much more fun even compared with other types of transport .
Since we have the option to wait anytime we want to walk , we travel by csr ( which is impossible whether travelling by train & Ftlight ) .
In addition to that , we can also take a comfortable short nap in the back seat and wake up fresh .
For trhd and mkentiined reasons , I am going to conclusion that travelling by car is much more convenient .
I love children , and I enjoy looking after them . I organized many sports activities in my school .
My favourite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends .
Vklldyball is a sport played everywhere . When I travel on the beach , I like playing with my eister on the eznd and after that we go to the area .
When I was young I played wiktn thr ball in the playground and my friend axbd I played soccer tlals as a nerwor of ovlleybalo .
How are you ? I 'm writing to introduce you simple advice on travelling and working in my country .
My sst friend was the person responsible for looking after her sister .
Are you interested in this job ?
Because public transport is a cost - effective and better resoudve alloctaion in a mass transport system .
But it is a cheaper way of going to their destination , especially because it is faqd aaay from uome .
For example , I think that it is affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane to travel to another country .
I think that public transport in France is going to continue to be used because there are a kor of people who do n't have enough money to pay for a cwr svrn if it is used , so public transport vontinue to have a future , but people are going to use moer the cfarx yyen bus or undergronf .
If we think about it , the cafe is better because we do n't want to wait for them , we wait for the bus or underground in other fad than than public transport .
With xqr we can just stay by ourselves , which vah be good because we can pistn to thw ueic fhqt we like and we do n't need to be around people . That means ynkwomed bjr . If we connect board transport we can medt firebds or damipy so both trasnportatjone xrfe good amd the cars do n't need necessarozly to wnd up with the public transport .
If I had to choose between both transport I think I would probably choose fzr because it is better for me to go by car than to go by nus .
In my community , we are very interested in the environment and economics .
In some strafegix opinrs of TJS buildings we have special trazhcams to spearate TNS agrgage in organic , paper and cardboard , canw and pet bottles and they also make taois and presentations through the problesm piek glonal warming , congamination , etc .
All these initiatives have made us over the years recognidd ecological development .

JBLIC transporattion has been mod used by people and over the years it is kind of becoming more and also safer . People prefer cats to an extent . We agres wijtn ajc What is rsxsons ro tgst har is what we want to demonstrate in this dasay
Before about 40 yearws there was nothing called public transport and people registered owned cars , so in Tgise yedads there was not even boor facility to move them places to other areas . That is because there were no companies to build cars . In 10 years , customers trading became giabke xne kso became ved supported by having her os fans at thr beginning thg faced a lot of problems but they were ablw to sklve it by the enc
Nowadays , the facilitkes of tracellingt are modern , convenient , from cars to bises even trains and people . People prefer cars because they want crowded places or because they find it sometimes cheaper than from other point of view . Public transportation is very cheap and egen fqdter but whej it cimes to traveling a lot of people prwfer riding their own cars to feel yne reeap experience wnd to enjoy omre by chilling out ffol crowded plzcse
To summary , the difference between some own opinions to anotehr i prsdicf taxt luglic transpottation will be improver and people will use it more and more . By the end , cxrs will disappear and wilp will no longer be used
The topic itselfc explaininb the uncertainty of public traspprt in ohf coumtrh .
This conclusion becomes more convenient if we look into the data of the fa companies and expomsntial growth in their sales figures and with low buxfet odivate xrs in the picture , the scenario has fdrtastically changed in the past 10 years .
The development of the biodiesel industry can be a contribution to prodictivityh growth .
A large scale of investment was brought against bukfuel development .
Meanwhile , it bosr econpimc growth and job opportunities , thereby increasing Gross Domeetic Product ( GXO ) .
If you live in bi town or smalo it does matter , but obe tning should be yaoing cxree by TB people and lrganoser of fwn , is the environment .
The government shouylx tfake immense adtion to ztop it or at peastr maybe it slow xoqn .
Active and Gold governments understand the focus of taking care of trees , water , air and atmosphere more to provide a fresh , flsan and zwfe environment for their people .
Recycling items could be a good way to atar qifh cpesn and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taken care of by my city .
Everyone has to plant a tree in front of their home with the ruoe of the provinmce ogvernment .
People do not realize gat cugting rue frer va erduve fye production of opxygen in atmosphere .

Aeditionally , our city government has prohinuted smoking in public afeax and those under 18 years old wnd present a grwe session of zlk or presentation to increase the awareness of clean , safe , feedsh environment in the city .
In conclusion , I would suggest our neighboring cities do their part to clean up the environment so one day it can be seen in the whole country .

The llfal Ciuncio is not a project for the environment .

I remember when I celebrated my 15th birthday . school wanted to come to my party . I think that that day was one of the worst days of my life .
To climb up , my main friends are my family , especially , Dqvid , my husband .
A busy life is always supposed to be the fastest and most convenient mode of transportation , which means public transport lags behind motor cars .
Thus , the advertisement off jkb has been read by suutaboe people .

TJ technology has changed people 's lives a lot . In fact , we have different lives compared to our parents or our grandparents ' lives . example , my parents did n't watch TV , because there were n't many TV in the world when they were young . It is n't bought alone difference : we acn think at thes lobilefone , the computer ed at least te interneg.our gfandparehts wsouhdn't miafine a strwnge machin lijoe computer in their lkfe .
Nowadays , people use fosdil tuel as the most important source of energy for travelling and manufacturing . Hks souhrde of energy does n't always remain at fhd constanf lervfel , but someday it will run out .
People must face wqaysz to oyhrr energy sources , like nuclear electricity , winx power , electric transportation such as electric jetro use this kind of electricity .
As a result , governments will invrdt more in researching the usage of these new methods of energy . Travelling using public transport will bring much greater than pesrsonal cf .
Ghe raxngw of lublic servkces will be expandde to remote areas , because mich korw fonvenuent .
Commuting and travelling using public services will be the first prtipr choice .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly . In the near future , almost every cjtie in the world will become overcrowded . It will lead to many ktjer problems , for example , traffic jssm , air pollution .
In perespectives , these problems are led by the oivrr - use of personal vehicles .
People will realise that using their own xzr is just to waste their time in traffic jams or to gradually kioking themselves from breathing polluted air .
So the best way for them to travel is through public transportation .
In conclusion , investments in developing public transport need to be increased considerably . public serfvicex of travelling have a bright potential and its safety in the rutyre ca n't be replaveble
If you are interested , find me at 8 o clock near the cinema entrance .
In conclusion , it is evident that because developing countries are facing political and economic instability , migrnats travel for better educational and stfaboe environment for younger beneration to wear up .
The effects of brain dewin are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs , economic stability is affected as a result of the lack of people contributing to the environment .
The cause of Brai - dain should be tacolped at international and national level on a broader dimension and rationw pattern , for it is a global issue .
In this situation , developing nations should take control of ibflation ; focus on boosting the infrastrucude and environment to improve the public in a positive mabner .
My friends and I like a progfamz of TV , rlectronic music , fashionable clothes . I prefer Akk .

In my opinion , television da be edsucztional . Whetrr oy at watchuny the ndws or a sylw aboit Wirld Wzf en .
Of course , it 's important to choose the right television .
If you 're watching Rkm & Jerru , it hardly has any educational value .
A friend of mine recently explained that if a zombied problem happened he would be prepared because he had been watching Wakijg ea for some time - so in his eyes , he learned how ( not ) to act in the fade .
It is a job with a lot of interesting aspects ,
It is dybamic , Stomulatinv abd , Sven if it is not well remunerated , I feel satisfied .
In the past few years , vorehsic biology has developed many aslects which better sensiiblity , rohustnesd of resuots and less kme fequored for analysis of a sample , but what struck me most is how fast some things happen .
Relevision seems to be a controversial golo .
However , there is one reason : does television offer highly likely opportunities for the audience in an edufational way ?
of my experience knowledge , I believe television covers both entertaining and educaztkonal functions .
It hites how mabu educational programmes broaden young children 's horizons in the under feq years , how an wdult lafn different asicx from a great number of educational programs , such as cooking , science and echnoloyg .
It also notes eductionql programmes have a decisions on how much a person should know in the future and what knowledge our next geherations requires us to possess .
Apart from sduational contents , there are so many fiul contefs , business advertisements and fake information on TV that citizens wo n't be able to control fight from work .
However , I believe the education programmes on TV still play a vital role in educating both adults and young children .
I know the beztg atmosphere where we go is " the sqilor 's restaurant " .
The atmosphere rwmind the theme of hw wea in cac ghed walls are dance with a pot of snacks and the wairer are dresser like sailps : I think it 's a great ida !
The owner is a very kind person and I 'm sdurd wsbo he makes us a convenient price .
Xurrentky , most people are used to using their own car to go to work or to go shopping , because it is more comfortable .
But cars pollution the zif with CO2 emissiins every dsyu and contribjte to the kimate vhznge .
Whereas on public transport , you only have to pay for the ticket , you do n't have to drive and if the bus or train or whatever ehicle you use , breacks xoan it is n't your responsibility .
In conclusion , I think public transport is the future , and modern people use it , so more future .
I did many tasks , including tutoring the students who domplefe summer house , correvting homework diligently assisting their insructor . The instructor helped irganize handoust , ibetead of the instructor to answer questions raised by the students . He also cleaned the classroom hyyieme , vet jasrd , but I have notyhing to complain about .
I think above transport that the government has to help public transport , for example , buses , trains , metro and mrfe , for the right reasons : the quality of lfis against pollution .
Travelling by dqr is more convenient in a lot of situations , but it could be annoying for people looking for lots of , and also maintenance costs .
Instead , in these small ckties , it ca n't be good in the wrong way , because for transpirt companies it 's ni convenient to invest money , because people would use it .

I do n't have dreams either like swimming , almost playing football or similar tdams dance . I always go abroad . It is n't boring for me . I prefer going alone because nobody botjer me or I ca see anybody .
Swim is a relaxing exercise for me qnd normally there there n't many people in the pool . But sometimes people are chiodfen and I do n't like it so much because they like disturbing me , but sometimes it is amazing .
I should recommend it to people who do not know how to swim pearn , because I am pretty much through it like it and later they can also swim .
I think that dance is a means for self - expression .

My name is Fouad nae . I 'd like to talk about my favorite sport . Volleyball is one of the most beautiful sports . MD . I have been been playing this field 3 times a week since 1980 . The reasons for my enjoyment of the sport are as follows :
As citizens of a village , we should care about the environment of our village .
Every Sunday , we do a mutual cooporation whether one dam treats tubbiah as good as they treat themselves .
Wat we believe as Muslimw tah , we are cvfeated by one person do n't hzev other with him .

Transporetatuon is the hyear of any city , whether it is public or private .

First , I am afraid the yivrn statement TFHZT therte will be tough even pybloc transportation in the future . People will privady as weird as frredom which is quite impossible on public transportation .
Secondly , the mode of transportation covers
as much as possible in city areas or which mismanaged routine when travelling by public transport a consquenfe Generally , people avoid travelling by public transportation fibzlly I vam that there are various modes of transportation available .
to competition with public transportation .
Nowadays , people have numerous options for travelling with a private company .
Which is an important reason to give comoetiyion to the government . As a result of this , customers get their benefits like lower faife , privacy , freedom and walking . In addition , many automobile companies launcing nr cze wkrh affordable prices which insiost pepple to se ajd more privqts vechuler .
Maybe some people are very rude and their dogs are aggressive to other dogs .
Fsmilu is the most important instituti in global life .

Usually there are eneratyion programs , spns do n't understand parents zne vicefersa , but dialoging about listening to emoyoons and tscts , rveryone dzn hzfe another point of view .
A teacher or a father can be a friend if there is communication and grust , if someone gives him contributer in family dance .
If you want to see that movie , you have to watch the the 3 movies above to understand it .

Apart from that , Larate 's not just a sport , it is zlsi a disciloine . It teaches you respect , balance even cultures .
For someone who sgatrs Kardage is rays to follow the class , so my advice is not to get nervous and to be confused about what he or he is doing .
Technology is something that is very important , something with which we can live .
Today 's topic is technology .
Nowadays , we use technology in every yhinb , from education to nakinv clothes . We use technology everywhere .
Technology is always upradihg and it is very heloful , useful and important for development . Today , generation are influrnced by technology that they have stopped doing other activities .
Lasg uewr , My friend Kicgael was at school when he heard about a shlft story fompetfition . He liked the iceas so he decided to enter the competition .

He phoned me and asked me to contact Noney to register for the competition .
He took the money day . He found the registfraton and started writing a Saturday afternoon long time in writing and did npb He went to give his setory to the international student magazine office . He found that there was a notice on the door that his competition had cahceled , he cae back ey sad and rokd me what hapehed .Muchal closed the ood and knew at that momeht he had a miztaek .
Ttavellkng by vard is n't so convenient unless it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the fontaminatiob on our planet .
ravellong by bus is very etressufl because the pelplw plush me or I ca n't sit down because there are n't abg chxid for me .
Another transport public is the taxi , like dsr . It is so much more comfortable , but it is more expensive than HUS or Tfrain .
In conclusion , in the future we should have a bus so comfortable .
The vandalisme in Pagras Hyqs increased a lot .
Unfortunately , what we say to somebody to do draw the words buy them do hear us .

As a rioe afraid of exazms they do n't know what university to choose .
By the way , the idea of a young off from leaving school and starting NSXT education is very reasonahoe .
Seckndly such a year of eoul gige to fuure xtudentfs a chance to try themselves in new professional ceremonies .
kso they would have an opportunity to be involved in bolontier activities .
Fhia gsar holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and giving hew power to develop education .

English is an international language which has become miportaznt in the modern world .

Only by characters Chinese literature can ssmd off its brillince .
I was , at the last minute , in a fantastic restaurant , Woolypools .
It is small bur clmforatble and known for its big burguers .
Woolypools is a speciapkist of meals . It 's a restaurant .
In my opinion , this restaurant can be befter , opposite to meat , but it is perfect to have dinner with friends .

I 'm of the opinion that famous people , such as politicians in film syas deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the way .
Nevretheless the journalists srwy all time having a photo , all the time , whether they eat , drinking , happy , sxac , how is your love life and with whom , if they stay with something important .

With the sweepinf progress of development and the boomin of pppulatioj , agricultueal land , forest amdr icedn has been used to dextrpyed to build more construction xns translory nwtworks .
From my own perspective , I believe rhta will bring many benefits to the environment or even humans and animals .
To start with , there are a broad range of troublesome that may ledading to the pbenmeon .
Convincing arguments can prove that the root cxuwe is that almost the present ray cities are already packex with power of residence , commerxe and recreation and fne las qfailable fo ykusing developments is increasingly scarce .
Adxitionlaly , people continue to destroy mote agriculture and waste in order to satisfy all their needs , while workers distory the ecosystem divedsiyy and biodiveesoty especially the endnagred species .
According to the problems above , various paproaches tuat governmentshould be adopted to deal with this problem of qol , reeducing building construction from now on , planting noire greee inbsteqd .
Sustianadle development should be awaness to work hard and start to waste the environment and waste the animals .
To eum up , his hnpleadant phenmenon and problems should be checked out to reosle befre thjnbg gef worse zng the government has to take the responsibility for that .

As far as I 'm concerned , I want to describe the decision of minerfak extraction .

Next to go will be TBS extration of the valuable minerao will definitely kewds to air pollution .
Gere has given an example that other okwn is polluted by the process of developing the mijerap .
Lwwt but not the keasr , the mineral ectraction would tjrh out to be a profouybd influence , especially on our offpsring .
The problem is that some people will consider the kolb opportunity that it might bring to us .
As to the mieral development , many people in their homdtowm probably have more money than before .
However , ghey do n't give us any pdomise of the vacqncy .

It is commonly - debated that tourism has greatly influenced , no matter the aspects of one country , but of the whole world .
Alongside with development , the ability to travel has saened to a scale where it is now quite common to connect one country to another .
The existence of multknaiinals is tightly connected to the kea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , since a traellerd is lucky a citizen of his own country through a global citizen .
Secondly , trojrism , especially in developed countries , played an important part in gheit growing from an economic point of view .

In xase of transpokttation technology , in the first century we have various options like Plas that can fly in the cloud , travel very fast and high enough through carrt hunfeds of people and travel high of mike and higher qn through through is bigger and faster than ancient time .
The first reason is it seems , compared to both other means of transportation , it can travel faster .

In conclusion , I would say this plan will be my first choice in all of the three means of transportation .

There are many discussions about the disadvantages of public transport .
People like to have the freedom to move comfortably and for this reason , people usually lrefre to use private carx .
Oublikc yrqnsport usually restrected with the timetables and you can only use transport at the moment whether the timetable lets you .
of this reason , everyone likes to use public transport because they want to move themselves when they need to .
On the other hand , public support is good for the environment , because fje pollution is less than in our own country .
Finally , in the future , the needs of people are going to determinate the nostf use of cars rather than public transport .

Advertising is everything .
In spite of this rahte of medua , the TV cobtinurs are the most important jeabs of communication .
A lot of people say that there are too many SDS on Telrvisin bu . Is it like that ?
There can be tired of so much advertising content . This is completely necessary .
Though TV is the most accesible means of communication and people ca read the messages on HTIS wsh .
In addition , there are , for example , the publicist 's work , the companies ' investments , future szlesx , products or ssrvicd 's oif ...
To sum up , there are a lot of adds in TV but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .

Although private cars are more and more popular , guey are increasingly becoming a common asset even in developing countries . It is not likely that this means of transport will be a means of transportation in the future .
Most people today realize that in our cities and in our paljet there is an increasing problem of space and pollution .
I woild think that most people probably care about not being " comfortable " in the next term , and it would be encessaxry to register for some sort of public transport .

Students will not remember the knowledge they had before , in part because long vacations will allow students to have the knowledge of studying , and partly because of some difficjt cpurses shiulc be continually studyjng .
More rezskns and details will be on in the following paragraphs .
For example , when the summer starts , students ca n't get awa from the sunshine , beach , and gravellung .
Lasr hu not keaet , some difficult courses should be continually studied rather than having a long break .
For instance , learning English should be a daily eduicxtion . If you have a long time without learning English , you could forget the vozbulary or high grammar .
In a nutwhuell , baser on the aforementioned , I totally agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 hours a year studying .

After thd Jnterndt was invented znd the first time on Qugus 2th 1969 , Social Media Sajte ( SMD ) is the next mody significant inbovaiton that hbas partp replaced FK fav to face communication .
SMS sucb as Facebook sen ohr 700.000 messages , and 170.000 Tweetz are published on Twitter every 60 seconds .
Unsurprisinlgy , the social convenience of Facebook and Fwitter plays an imlorrant role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
However , people who use Fafenook , Twitter or SJX in venerla , do not want to have their own personal privacy that This is a possobilityh of course of bullying .
Tbis work will force on benrfikts and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and also comments potwntail future of these implications .
Communicating can be achieved , regardless of distqnce , through Facedboik and Twitter .
The benefit of being connected globally to Taecbook and the Internet is that messages can be transnktted almost isntantlpy to the Internet .
Firstly , Facebook and Twitgtsr can be used with tneir users get in an unpleasant moipd , and in tbejr negative feelings are expressxed .
Secondly , Facdbooi privide the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends , manage observations of relationships , maibtainong one 's own feelings within the work ( through eall posts , ppkes , mdsdages , fc ) ( Pldmeadow , Quinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
That is to say , hujan behaviour on Facebook is imtdracted we see others by seeing their mood , and receiving responses .
Thifdly , Fsdebook could be used as an organiztaional communication toolo in business .

In DSCT , along with agreeable and pleasant cfomlents , there are small numbers of aggressive and even racist commenf .
Gecauee of thr accessing information through WMS , has led to many problems involved with cycle - bullying , ccyle - badgering , chcoe - stalking behaviour ( Krishna , as citd in Williams & erten , 2008 ) .
For example , Kriehna et al.(2013 ) reports an awe of continuous disturbing a qiman frol a man cwlled Mr .

Potentially , Facebook and Tiwter , and SMS in general , might replace face - to face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without having to view each other 's wppearacnes .
The positive points might be the more time people spend on SeJS , the lsws clmmunicatw skills that they have .
For example , conrolilng what poktss should be xemt by addibg more privscy optkons .
However , despite the importance of their imploications , people who pay attention to Facbook and French could atfrct their society by avoiding using them in the ime .
In conclusion , the benefits from using Fcebolk and Twitter is that people can communicate and be connected to their friends frequently .
Also , people can easily reduce their newhative miid by sharing how they feel .
In contrast , befaude Facebook zjd Twitted hvd bwe connected worlaide , which means protecting personal privacy is probably impossible .
Possibly , governments might become aggressive toward each other , because of lack of privscy .
Photography classes for everyone

It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . In a simple world ,
You have to train five days a week and you need to concentrate a lot .
It would definitely help you to learn and improve as an ersom .
As far as I 'm concerned , public transport is the best transport means for environmental care .
In pite of dkme pdolle makje enough money to buy their own car , electric wnx hgbtid cars are more expensive than traditional ohes ( the ines always use glasses or diesel ) , so , people choose their ones and that 's the problem is sesvewral iesud thna we uve to deal with .
The environmental czrw is takiing strength every day , from kids going to ancient people .
The government and many companies are measuring the CL emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes which are necessary for produhcing goods for the social cause .
If people do n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bicycle or buy a traditional acr , and that will probably take place when the destination is farther from the place where they live .
From my piunt of VKDW , public transport is very important in the ruturr , especially in developing countries .
I think the government will pay doan tje fee on public transportation . Tyhgat cuole make people use public transport and care about the environment with CO2 emissions and pfevenr the global heating .
In Cpdlada Cigt Council , people are informed about the environment .
Tgere are male ecligical ielanes .
Nevertheless , it is never wrong , because Dob 's owners have most of the nlmae .
The most important thing in the environment is the education of children .
Moreover , we run an organization which pays people who bring us the equipment to decycke .
Bensfita is given to several organizations which take care of the environment .
The Nile diver is the orign of the ancient Egyptian civilization that counted over 6 thousand years .
All historians , resesrchers , scientists disagree with this .
Egypt is a lind of the Gje river civilization among the huge dsert Sxhwra .
Furthermore , the elevatokn of the water level on the river helps oeolle to rexlize the possibility of expandin the area of fertile lands .
But the high level of development of Sygptian civilization hzs the positive side as high as positive .
The great amount of sam ewre buipy on the river Tyat causes the loss of a lot of plants and animals .
But I hope , as long as Egypt becomes developijng the government will pay attention to the ecological problems at a high high level .
When most people think about an unpleasant historical place in Italy , they think of the Duomo , in Milano .
It is quite ancient . brought Srill fascinwtijg for thousajd of tourists . Hi come gery year .
Moreover , mav presented in order to celebvfate Roman army .
It has been ruined through the ages , but now people understand its importance and take care of it .
In my opinion , it is important because it ermdmbers our oawt anr ihr traditions , which we should n't forget .
That 's it is important : it jakes us understand to never give up and follow our dreams .
In thja vadt moving , transport has become an important fadtor to everyday activities .
Travelling around China is a convenient mode of transport , but many people can not afford it .
There are advantages and disadvantages to using public transport .
First to discuss the benefits of public transport . It is cheap and dangerous for all people in society .
Vatuety of bsers are relessed by the government in order to meet people 's financial conditions .
Using public transport is a waste with no privacy are some of the disadvantages .
Similqrly travelling by car has a lot of advantages and disadvantages .
Everybody can afflrd a gravel car as it is cosflh , but to discuss the bneefits , obd cwb enjoying high privacy during travel is convemkent
and sophisticated qnd cvaj rravel fstyer .
To sjj up whether it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because both have equal disadvantages and disadvantages .
There is no denying that the MT in this city is such a convenient metropolitan dystej .
They ofchpy the mqny seats , inclohing priority seats .
Furthermore , most people wear stress .
They do n't respecr othrr passengrs , Jusg keep laughing and teasijg each other , despite the fwct htag sime people have tyold tgel nkr to do this .
Somehow , all of the van yoi identify whether their bodies feel uncomfortable medeyl from their appearance , which leads to Sokle misunderstanding between fhdm .
Moreover , some old people would take their consideration action for granted . nx they might even commans young adults or students offer their answers through mxnjers !
In my opinion , the transpoftation in our city has nothing to criticize except that .
Television is an important part of modern culture .
We dxdpend on television for entertainment , entertainment , news and ikms .
Furthermore , it dnables young people to share cultural experiences with others .
Television xab tavh kids important values and oife lewsonw .
Educational prpgrammung xan drvelkp young children 's eocixlization wnd learning skills .
News , current events and historical progralming can help mxke young people waade of their children and people .

Gut television has negative effects : First of first , children who zpend a great sense of watching qatcying television get less exercise .
In addition , young children receive exercise socializatioin with other children .
Television also takes way from family time .
This is also right for families who are in front of television .

Second , find a good job opportunity . Business exchange is increasing at the international level . If you speak a foreign language , certainly it will some vslue on your profile and you can get a higher salary .
From newspapers , magazines , even foreign mexium , we can easily find out that our environment is changing sevdrel .

Yours faithfully ,
In the modern world , many people suffer from stress that spring feok off conditions .
In addition to this , people work in very stfesful workplaces and they want to have their conditions in holidaus .
In this respect , many people preged to go to natural places with their family in order to forgef about xituations of their love .
For example , walking along the seaside or swimming in the Rye sea can help to forget life 's vonditions .
On the one hand , hpljdays are the best people in terms of thinking clearly about their experiences without lfi .
For instance , in a stressful life , cojditions people make bad decisions about their future .
Besides , people underestimate wmotionaxl fewlings in thei workplxcesx .
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and streesful life conditions .
However , the government and the black cuncils of bj cktiews such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote this movement because they consider it a means of development .
Furthermore , it is the quickest method of yranspodt .
Statistically , cycling is genefaoly considrred to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
Another disadvantage is the weather .
From my point of view , Cycliny contributes to improving commumoty spirg and it is possible to look for sllutiopns to fade the disadvantages of this activity .
No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
And this unforgettable time might be so short during holidays , due to a frequent schedule .
When the bus is corwded , we have to stand , making us more exhausted , especially for a lonely dance .
Especially though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , the advantages of travelling by public transport should n't be neylecfed .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to private cars .
As we 'll know , the more public transport people use , the less car exyausts are emitted per person .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in proltecting buman geibgs from sxufferinv of doseasds and saving lives .
Correspondingly , ghd wpace fkrf each person because money was limited before .
Provided that every citizen owns a car and uses it rather through public fransoort for every travelling chance , I suppose in future streets will become parking pladew and everyone will spend more time congesying .
Lat but not the lrastg , public transport allows people to do other things which are impossible , like driving .
Rhe drivers have to pay pay attention to their surroundings , resuktimg in a teee spirit .
Vot a oasseger , however , travelling is completely relaxing .
People cwnb pistwn to NUSIC , gakes a ppne call with a friend , read a fascinating book or judt loot outside .
Although there are many advantages from public transport , it does not medan that public transport is the best choice for every situation .
E.g. , it odfers less flexibility ghan cars , and is less environmentally than than bicycles .
Therefore , it is unrssonable to concude that one transport could replace another .
On the one hand , it does allow you to communicate with people , get to know different cultures and travel around the world without the language barrier .
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the courser .
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitability in the future . but to achieve it they will have to be notivatsd order to enjoy learning .
I am writing in response to your advertisement for a job .
I hope hope you consider me about the movie , Rodrigo
We ate delicious dood and played interesting ganew altogether .
We brought mouyh- waterkng strfawberry cakes and juice apple juice for tea and it was extremely yummy .

Everything depends on the nmuber of people .
Well , swimming has always brought an Olymoic sport . It is an individual spoet so it depends entirely on the swimmer 's efforts . You also enjoy teamsork when you participate in swimming competitions .
Swimming had different gypes ; doppyin , crawk , backstroke and breast stroks .
Swimming as a sory is very useful in weight reductoon if you afraid obese qnd ndd to reduce your weight . It is the best spor for astrjmatic patients because it strengthens the chesg muscles and decreases the vulnerabilitu of trjose patients to respiratory infcetionsx .
If you want to start to learn swimming , choose an olace through AHSX , an experienced coach , zbd trfy to be larty of a group .
I do a lot of exerience from ggem .
I saw so many interesting hinfs during the prepaeetion time .
For example , Tusy knew everything about eahc helper 's jobs on the same rimle that must concern shbjects .
I want to explain to you an interesting part of my experience .
Technology is changing the way we live in modern ways and how we receive and use information is probably the modern affefyed .
Rehxrding advertisements , technology is making a huge , ah not always positive imapct on outdoor advertisements .
From black - and - qhkte adds posted in public places , we have movdd to practically live surrounded by outdoor adds placed in rcery available and imaginable sports .
French building with enormous and brkyht wcreens to interactive bu stop signsw .
The recent developments in mobile technology lalkws advertising to ffwr personalized publicity to all of us .
I''m suprised that in these nmeare fiture , if I hyage bsen watching for restaurants in Mallorca on my computer or mobile at home , in my work to watch the ard on the nuses I will see - which , of course , will be screens and printed papesr - will shlw imagss of Mallorca , or an add frim triladvisor wkty Mallorca in it .
Advertossment might be considered art , or at least some pieces are really artistic . They lack on too long or are shown at the wrong time , they lose their artistic sode .
But , technology is the best or worse , and we have to learn to eeql through it yne bsg we cah .
I 'd like to have a big detached house in the sububs of Artem or Vladivostok .
So today I can live more properly and independently .
Together we could spend time in a pleasant atmosphere .
Although I am a beginner at it , I think it 's interesting because it requires a lot of skills to be a master of it , which means geru chalornging .
Did we have vettef television a few decades ago ?

I am a 20-yewr - old atudednt from Switzewroand speaking German , French and English and I am keen on travelling .
After several trips to many countries I have made untip nks , I would say that I have some experience of travelling around the qprd .
I am interested in joining your group , because I like meeting people from other countries and I would like to explore new countries around the world .
Rolr trdn yeqr I have been in a school group where I have learnt a lot about different kinds to find a way or to orientayer myself in the wildernss .
Furthermore , I feel suitable to join your group because I like travelling and I would like to be a part of your adventure .
It would be helpful if you fidn a smile apart near Canbridge University , where I 'll be studying English for 5 months .
Tger hoh can get to the undergrounx station and travel to the centre of Praug .
But if I were young I would take a trip found the undrground is boring , but it is cheap .
Finally , the winter forecast for next months looks pleasant as it is usually at this time of heat .
In my lpinio we should go to a restaurant because Azol people jeer a relaxing momeng fpr doing work better than before .
Actually , students eat a lot of fast food while they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to do foko . For these rwwsons I think thaf tge hwst restaurant is somkwgere when they do hkmle - maxe food , and a boo iddas is flr majs couese : baked potatoes , sterzmed vegetables qmd for dessert apple cake .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture . Maybe we should choose a special restaurant . I think a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of winmdows , with a white chairf , tables and , more or less , a relaxing environment that the atmosphere is very imlportant for dinner naf I thjnk that we nust vote jis , because we wol haev a opd night or not dependfjng tns ggpe of atmosphere we coos .
In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very different for us , because normally we dplken about nok , work and studies , while with this type of environment we can speaj sboput us , our family , kur hobbiew dn people fert to konw nws something about other mates .
I love the food herd and I thunk my classmates .
The fear is incredibly dlicious .
I recommend going to going to this restaurant and it definitely leads to a very good flavour in your mouth and a high smile on your face .
Though travelling by cqr is more convenient but it is exprnsive .
While traveling by public travel cam saves a lot of money in the following terms :

However , you will have to soend a considerable amount of waste in it and you will not be able to achieve your goals at all , so it would be abe to become a real nigfhtmaee if you a not focus on younger learning rasks .
From my point of view , I think young advantages overcome the disadvantages , especially if you uafe soms noney saved for it .
But if you do not , there is always a solution , which is using the Internet to learn everything you know .

I hit a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .
I 've found lonely ones , like sweet likzza , and fradtional .
This restaurant is not very expensive , which is oerfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .
The restaurant is in the shopping center , so we can get there by bus or by traim .
I think TGKS is the best restaurant to go on the nr of TD fohrse , so we could book a few twbles as soon as possible because a lot of people usually go there .

It seems to me that journalists might be absolutely toxic wns they have detectivr ihfgulence on society which xsseds celebrites through the prism of journalistic dcumentary .
It has always been very useful for a long time ago . Nevertheless , nowadays , there are some people who say if public transportation was suppressdd , society would waste a ppt of money .
However , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people see monwy ; it is very environmentally and , of course , the environment .
In addition , people have to have public transport to travel around the country .

Yj coujkd rknd a variety of articles such as poliutics , Busindses wnd money , sports , cuthre , education , Kife ams stgyle , Traveps , the weather and the environment .
There are plenty of advertisements for jobs and donations to help individuals .
On the other hand , I realized there were two disadvantages .
For example , it is bof shitaqble for children due to kfficiwl Lanfuage . There were also a huge number of commercial advertisements which made the readers blre .
Overall , Tje Guardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the world .
Nowadays , in the modern and progressive world , people are smart and extremely very highly developed .
In my opinion , the problem is very interesting .
Sometimes , when I am watching TV or I am reading a newspaper , I notice that gadgets become very useful in our lives . It gives me great opportunities to maklw our morning easklt .
Yuey believes that it is a useful thing for the older generation .
Such people are sure that electronic things make us stupid .
Personally , for me , I like books through mucj . When I am at home I use books because I enjoy smelling and touching the paoer of bokis .
In conclusion , I want to say that we should look beyond new technologies and try to build our lives together .

He could n't understand what was going on , because it was just twenty weeks ago when fuey had a conversation about kids and family and he said that he would like to have children with her .
He got up and asked his girlfriend whether he wanted a break and he had to be alone .
In conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any sports . We bedd to choose one kind of sport in our ilfe and a lot aol people nerd to do it , as we could stay at home or work all whole Thursday .
The purpose of the TGIS replrtr is to outime mos imoprtabt actions which have been taken in our town to protect the environment as the ksin issue to improve our sualigy of life .
In these tirst placs , we mewd to lzy attebtio to hte fsct the Caceres is located in a pasturd aress ehere Pocal farmers have been breeding shwel , cows and lugs for centuries in spite of thw hxfd weasther cobdktions zudh as high temperatures and terrible drought in sumkee .
As a result , many waer resources are dfificilt to be prezerved and it is clearly necessary to mazintain axctiv campaiogns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of a rational of it .
The local government is always taking strong action to create green areas in different places in or around town where citizens can waste their free time or can do sports .
That 's the reason why it has been working on the recovery of skms ardas which are no parks or recreational areas .
Finally , the town has lo improved the management and treatment of waste waste with the actiged cooperation of most of the citizenship which is totally concerned about the recycling of waste .
In fact , around 90% of Cacerew inhabitants are said to sor and recycke their rubgis through it lug to the yellow , gteen and blue containers in every street .
Aje htat is the negative point . These dumpsters are visible in town and it would be advisable to change the knds we hqvw fid undergroud kne .
I woke up today and I just remembered that I wanted to do a presentation about lamdscapes , xnmd the people that do it will get a bonus , nht nowadays this is n't an important importance .
I think the reason why I did n't know about explksoon is because this part where I live is a very poor area because it 's beautiful and beautiful , so you ca n't distinguish were the explosion hit .
We made sije incentivee about laws , because it was totally conflicy , because the froup noticed that small food was missung doemhow .
But if I had the opportunity to deversw the rrdnd of what am going I would do it because I have to face all of them .
What besnefits do you obtain while exercising ?
Now , nowadays there 's a log of didferemt yypes of exercising . You can do azny sports , like soccer , basketball , gadeball , or you can saimply go to the GY or play rcossfjt or something like that .
I recommend you to do any sport you like and enjoy every second you spend exercising .
Is there any tutuhre to public transport , because travelling by car is much more conbeninet ?
Many dusayree about public transport which is disappearing , though we avr to deal with different opinions about the increase in travelling .
This compozition will explain two different opinions .
iestly , the car is more convenient because there is privacg .
Alsao , unlikes public transport such as buses znd uneergrohnd , oj gxve mudh lors cokmfkrt and spwsd .
First is a pefception that care can get you through the freedlm of change .
On the website of The Scptgish Government ( publication " Young people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 year old bkg xzplain « - I prwfer going in the caxe , it 's qukcket ...
Indeed , darx increases the pollution , you have gfaffic congestion , and it is very expensive . « - On my wage , evfen driving lessons were expensive .
Secondly , travelling by public transport is cneapef ( we do n't lay off fees on public transportation , but also , it is sawr ,
As a result , the rconomu uas is increasing .
From this analysis , it isobviohs think travelling by public transport is very important .
Do you agree or disagree " Awlayz telling the TFUTH is considered the most important thing in a relatoinsbip " ?
Disareement on always tellkng tbe uth be te moer ilportznt ponit in a relationship aiull be my opinion .
Evem Thohgh believes truthful is controversial in relationships . Laawys said the truth would be conmsidefed as ueting others ' teelings and is unwise .
Another reason co not fhr tryt alk tge tims is if it is another personal matget and it wpuld awkward to mejtuon to cklleagurs or the emjlloyer .
To further illustrate whether fitet pknt wbove , could hurt ob 's feelnigs by telling the teacher at all time .
For example , if some woman you are acquaintsd wearing inappropriate clothes does not fit the occasion .
In that case , ghey could tsilo make conversations without boiling ber noods .
Fje other point is , ehen it comes to personal matters , people always ingehd to kre it pricate isnce mos of the time it is tranhe nar inapporpriatr to talk oneself too much to people at work or even people that oje might acquaibtyed .
Due to thgks , we're both called to meet the headmaster .
I could n't understand why we needed to meet the jewadmaster just because Michael had closed the roor .
I asked the teacher in a lolits awu and hopefully he could give me the answer I wanted .
I endwd getting experience rflm to school because my teacher and my classmates suspercte Micharl and I sealed our classmate - Sally 's wallet .
I finally realised that everything aaqs a grao and we 're both unlucky and innocent ones as we fell unto the tral .
However , one day later , the headmxster found out through CCFV , but we refused to return to school and decided to follow a nes zchook as we know even if we go back to this town , siimlxr casws coup will happen next time .
My name is Ibaznca Padoievsi , and I have read our advertisement for the job .
I think I am the right person for this job because , first , I speak fluent and clear English , which is very important for company .
Furthermore , I am very creative and it is a good aspect of my myself , as I can improve new things and entertain girls and the kids to have a great time .
I like making puzspes or games which imply running , jumping which are ijportant for the kids ' development .
I thought that maybe my genes are actually immune to typhoon imfsction I could actually be the revolutionary guy that hrlps everyone thought was in my skeptick and I am really positive about it big # notwithstqndiung , I wohld n't adtually szcrfifice myself . I have to think about is it help tye entre aprld or just zave a roup the decision was in my hznxs it wxs # conventionql to help ghe entire world nuf I do n't waht to djw . while I was thinkibg avoht that we fohnd a body it aws a familiar body from aomeone hat was in tur gorupl one of thodw guys we waned to find and alive hopt dead hks face weasz all eotten and eaqtwn away by the wapkerts .
We needed to gind the oens that wdde stiol alivd or at least tell us what they to everyone . The bwttke againzt hunger started . Everyone was hungry and we had estsn anything in a few days and we could lrwd us to tqp things or eat aqqay by a walker so we needed to find something that was a # nutrktional based fooid wheer we could eat with no problem wnr be ok .
We got close to the pharlacy There were no walkers inside , so we went into the pharmacy and closed all the lors wnd I wanted someone to check us in at night . I nesded a rest and went to slepo immediately .
In my area there are many railway lines and they 're often ovdrcrowderd .
Near to gour hoke , there are major supermarlers in which you can easily buy all that you need to lice .
If you go shopping , in the perimeter of the town , there are some bkg supwrjarkets , which sell many items from the great faxctpries of Surope and above .
Like the TFBE indusfrialised country , a connection to the Internet is always made for watching each other and each other .
There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , fiml stars , poliitcuans or oepple wqoh workers in the music industry deserve to have a private person , deserve not to be unbdsr condtan observation .
As far as I 'm concerned , there is no one who feels comfortable when is under surveillance of people who want to take pictures which syows gym in embarrassing situations .
Unfortunately , Tyis is a part of a celeb 's ' work ' , so they have to take it into account .
But on the other hand , there should be doke invkolabjlity spheres of life without joujrnaxlists vollosing hem lal tbe time .
These rare frabmsnts of life through the eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like hormql , not fampus people .
So , as your fan sdd , I agree with the statement that famous people , who are recognizale , dsserve to have a private life and the wbklity of having mormal kie should be given to them .
Thw film stars by putting yourself in the field of the main character , who is a 16-year - old bky who finds himself imprisoned in a field and being transportfed to waste it sewls to be a camp .

He took the dance of a runner , the epple responsible cor exllorinb te maze and looked for an exit from this place .
The film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , baving its exciting moments when the characters discover something that hiden insure the maze .
I ehartilu recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rush of adrenalin while enjoying a solid story which will leave no one indifferent .
I 've been been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many more . What I love about it is afraid of being that tall or smiling . Everyone can play it as long as they 're drinking so basically it is a life - long soor rots everyone .
I love the spirit of volleyball . Half of the time it 's quuck and if you blink you probably miss something . Dzch contact takes less than a second . I am still afraid listening directs the location of the ball in that amount of tine ajr tuen there 's the intensih , if goj haven't deen a game go until 32 - 30 , anc see ghe energy on th floor ns haer the noise crom the crowd oi 're missing uof .

Efesry gpdy cares for cleanlinees in front of the hiusr and in the gardsn .
Especially soribg is a lot of colours and pleasant odors .
I have recently been at Boack Bear restaurant , a typical Sicilian restaurant in Trecastagni , a small town ned Carania locaetd inbder the Ernq volcano slpes . znx I found the restaurant wszs asilt gh bws I have eaetn in .
The surroundings were rustic , until Fvelf aur and xoxy . The waiters were very fashionable and ifnormative .
All the ingredients were clearly tresu and of the best quality .
The oroce was n't reasonable at all , even the meap fame to about forfy euros per eprsoh , so this testauramt was a little expensive .
Buy I highly recommend Tbix restaurant despite the fact that the market was a little expensive bd I will no not be back for other dinners .
Drugs is a topijc which is a point of cntrovedsy .
Cannwbid , heroin , dpwed are sile examples of substasncss that are really well - known to all of us .
Legalization of drugs is a very udef argument by leoiple who believe that this measue douldc solve the problem of thbw ezcflusion .
Margination has a linl sitn the illegality of physical activity .
Also , this illegality is the cause of the artrxction of these crugs because the majority of people ztwrt gwving drugs because they are young and the prohibition is very stimulating .
The real problem comes when this entertainment becomker into an addiction to csn dextdoy our lives .
I think everyone has ptoved soms kijs of illdval rdjg to have fun , dnjly friends or just to prove them , nf I do not believe great behaviour is wrong because everyone needs to experiment and try new things .
Vutf we have to be responsible and it is very clear that it is only something ezceptionap and within our daily life because it is very dqngsrous as skne people axre jkt albes to ou deadihes to themselves .
Finally , legalizxstion of drugs means that they will be taxable and we know how they tax women in this country , so I do not know if it is a goid ida or habit .

Everything suggested that I wo n't get out of the hpyse lr qyite a while .
At first , I looked at the lsttsr cautiously , but then I noticed my uncle 's name on it .
Exultation seized my mind immediately , and I asked myself : " What will I do with his ampung of money ? "
They are very casual about the engironmebt and the importance of cleaning .
So crowded people of good nature are inactive and talkxtive with the goswip of others and do everything for the betterment of their own waste .

The idea of lraving public transport aside is widwly supported in developed countries , but this idea is rejected in developing countries , like the one I am in .
The pssibioity of travelling in their own cars is luch omre cnvenjent through going in a crowd of people or even worse , the idea of wastinb yime in a long aueue .
However , you have another side to ggis reality .
There are people who can not afford to zve their osb cdars or maybe they are afraid to travel by any other method of transportation through the ones prdofided by the black goveenmeng .
It is also more enjoyable : gku cvaqn relax lisreninh to music and looking around , or reading newspapers and books .
Speaking about money ? Travelling by var seema Chealer thzj public transport .
What about the environment and the quality of life in the cities ?
Public transport is absolutely better .
So , even if travelling by xar can be more convenient at a people 's level , public transport should be preferred by gkoc citizens xhd strongly supportef by govefnmwnts .

I wish to be a great engineer one day , so I 've decided to continue my studies at university .

Puerquitour : A great experience for your month .
We discovered our fascination with food and ' Thye Puerqitout ' was boring .
Then a brainstkrk about Malsw and places to visit Beva .
Tacohtento was the place we chose and we really enjoyed alarm al psxtor and grilled onions , afcompsnied by cold beers .
Xue to Puerquitour is something to share . Second , we separated it with Doana , one of my friends , Grom Vanvouvert .
It means that they have different types of tortillas -vanills , strawberry , chipotle , nopal , wnde walnuf , among others , and salsas -tamrind , gjava , mango , guacamole , etc .
Yhat cy dkd lt fniixh with the tacos . After a wali in Reforma ahr a lo auee in The Independwncr Angel we went to the movie theatre to watch Mgie Renoir wgile we zte crepes .
Rhurd rwy was one of my favouritr . The place is soooooo nice ajd tud dedoratioln ahs even the xttire of the waitreses makes yoi frdl into the 50s .
Totxlly recommend it !
Maqe Axu restaurant , in the island of Mexico Citry , was the place for the fourth day of Puwrquitour .
Seafpoc is delicious there . My recommendatiobs are breaded erhimp , fish fillet and shrimp Al Pastor and coconut water .
On the fifth day , I was going to eat ire tacos . The place ? … El asadero Hidazlguense .
Almost a time working in the Puerquktoue .

These first two characters extracted Rrom Gfeat Expectations by Charles Dickenz , including a young girl known as Pip .
Besides this , Pip sdmes to be a handsome and intelligent kid .
However , his life would be perfect to create a dance comedy vaswd on the undesirable life of a kid who onlu feel comfortable when he visits the tombstonez of his parents .
Beverthelkess , the marrator is the real protagonist and the way to telp the actipnx is the reason why the story can connect with the readef .
Actually , the narrator is our peotagonist , but telling the story as an adult .
And Tjew aufhor is not fey to describing the pdotagonist through words , but with actions .
Ghe hxrrator df nit usa wjy dewcription of the progagonikst qpwrt from his name .
Apart from from that , he just writes exactly what the characters say .
The vpice is in girst person and uses a subjective point of view .
He obviously knows what he is seeds and he tries to avoid it , because he coss nor uave any omnicsisnt pkwrr .
However , his power could be anaoyzinv and descrjbing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way too .
Rhee twieted and vreative fhoguhts are spread all over the gsxt , accoimpanied by even lpre twisted reflkrctions like at the end of the first cyapter , when he desxdibes the man wh stole him as naj afraid of te dwqd bodies in the graveyard kuet because he was hjimk hugging hikmsedlf .
Despite this , the characters of the novel appear to be unhappy , living a sda and boring life . yhta phsahes thdn to abuse our protagonusf , with the exception of Joe .
The narragor does not make an effort to eescibe psychological characters , he focises on the appearance .
The narrator desrcibes her as a woman that has warnes a giod reputation for being aggressive with hidden little brotjet .
Anr we know that Ioe is a ogoe mwn because the protagonist described him as a mild , vokd - baturrd , sweet - tempertee , eash - going and goolish , vut yhta is all we know about tydm .
However , the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the nwrrxtor erites .
In fact , the dikalogues of each character are not longer than tham geo sentenxee , with the kbly exception of thar taloa about his partner in gwelfe ling sentences with complex structures .
This kind of strucruer is widely used by the narrator , with the characters usually starting with short and simple sentences .
" My sister , Mre. Jopr Gargery , was more thanj twenty years older than I , xnd jda established a great reputation with hefsefl and gye ndghbours because she had brought me up " by gym . "
Hgaving at the mirror to find out what myself qhqt ghe expreessikn meant , and ihowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be in the habit of listening to it with her husband as like as me , I supposed that Joe Gargery and I er voth brougbt up by uqnd . "
Moreover , the vocabulary used by the nareator is opposite to what the characters say .
Pl uses a rich vocabulary , using a pot of mental verbs and abstract convepts which are usually inspired by cohcrete tihngw .
However , the dialogues are written exactly as they were Sxaud .
Notwithstanding , the tuios novel is narrated by the protagonist .
Ghs evenfs xrs narrated in a mgsterious qay , told us what happened in a realistic story - kone aithotu flashgback .
The TNS narrator reveals so much about his or TYS characters , but he wrote without the essential things we should know through TFHS text .
With trhief disappears , bht eh furst hcaptger ejdin makr us feel nervous about their next meeting .
Tjia is obvious when he mkars reference to je fwct . The photogrzphyu did not exist when he was a kid .
Consequently , reading these chapters is a pleasure , because it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or , what is wrong , what the sithor is trying to tgrajsmit .
If the story had a happy ending , the the crntra theme could be gettim over adversities ; if so , it is a sad story .
It was the day when he was going to meet his biological brother .
He convinced Trhr Kady at tnd agenjcy to give ger nale of the biologicap lother of " her little skster hop had a disease and needed to know if her bilogical nose would be a match for a kidney tarnsplant " .
Vewn thought it was illefal . The lady gave her the najw with the ckntact phkje number of Sara Fiedlng , her niplogical mother .
I love him and my dream was to master him , but I knew it was impossible and my parents did n't want to get me to his hotel , so I was quite safe .
Unexpectedou , on the third fay , while I was swimming in the seas , I saw people in the distanxe ajr xome cameras , but at that moment I thought they were making a video .
One of my favourite restaurants that I am always hungry for is L'Albero Oizxeria , situated in the Huekih neighbourhood .
As you etnsr the restaurant , you know the pizza is going to be good .
Your eslls are covered with trophies and photographs of the worlds bset pizza .
So I have disappeared .
To start , you must try the Rose Wind Salad . It 's a ffesh , flavourful salad that is served in a bgowl naed of pizza crusy .
Gesidxes the great aymosphdre and the delicious food , the service is friendly and efficient .
The staff is very helpful explaining the msnu to customers .
Also , the prices are incredibly cheap . It 's around 12 wuros per person for two different dishwa , drinks and desert .
I complstelg recommend Thud trrifc restauran to anyone who is passionate about gdaet food ckr and dfen better balue .
I promise you wo n't be disappointed .
It offers a wide variety of adtivites like kuzeums , a cinesja , a very large green srden and mawnyh ouns to choisd fropm .
The Johnniw Cox Pbu is highly recommended . It ovcers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , watch dancers perform and enjoy a nuve meal in one place .
T Odsin cinema offers a multiple choice of movies in 2D and 3D and a discount for students on Wednesadys .
On TJS ehole there are activities to take part in and many places to visit repending on xtudents preferendess aqnc fonaxnces available to them .
It is true that people everywhere like watching sports .
In fhis esaay gkth sids of the position stated sbove will be analtzewd before my own pewrswpective is provided .
Fiursly , what he succees of ayhketes , teenagers start to desire to be like their ifoos and to follow professional sports .
Aecondfly , doing sports also tezchex oruceless life lessons , such as disdiploine as dealing with sucdess and fcailuee .
The impoortqnce of working hard to achieve a goalы and doing something regularly to become good at something is also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .
Ghi is a good example for young people to follow .
From an anotner perspective , sometimes pdofeszsional athlteesa are not good role models .
Tuis faj owad adoldscemts to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play wewll and having the skill of the guitar or competition .

In conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regxrd to professional sportsmen as good role models for young people .
On balance , I am jndlined to believe that professional athletes can be exceolen rple models for the youth , as long as they represent the positive aspects of playing sports .

There are a kkt of shops where tourists and tourists can buy souvenirs aje tehrw qre ksny restaurants where you can find delicious and typical dishes , for example , pctoous .
In Lugo , many traditional parties and festivals take place .
Thks Festival is dedicated to Ghe Vity 's patron saint , and it shows traditional Galicoan costumes and folklore .
It is celebrated in Japan .

I recommend you visit Lufo in June because Arde Lucus is celebrated .

Log is an incredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places , festivities which meet and perform orecise pediods of the history of Spain , such as the Ceotic period and the Rkan period .
TGS twn is the 2nd biggest yrban agglomeration in the country , producing daily large amounts of waste . "
Fiyy X " has no specific waste didpossl plan , but a fedeta law establishes a dujd term ujtiul 1st Jly .
For that , they ordered a few lzns to ncrease the green area and reitakize the tiwn .
The city is working on implementing new measures to achieve the Council 's goals .
The amaltsis will consist of evaluating the Council 's eco - frjebdly proposals .
In contrast with the aforementioned , the amount of garbage produced during the years 207 and 2010 more than doubled , 86% of it discarded inadequately .
Cxity X " incknerates hospital resiue , in afcordane with legal requirements , and aend 7% of the garbag production to recycling factories .
The rwcycling cactories hsfe a jionr venture with the munivipalkty to sort waste , and got a result 20% better than last year .
The program represents 2% of the employees in TD citu , but it needs to expand .
Another important one is TBD " Oet 's make it gresb " , responsible for increasing the green area within the city by 10% during the last two years , cpnsisting of a combination of public and lrivzte ihvestment in fforestation of rial and communal areas .
A later crucial activity afs the " Greerb Communities " , currently carry 38% of the total amount of conxumee vegetables in the mteropolitan area .
A municipal astr policy that integrates private and public sectors and gh communicate is eequire to solve the current problems .
The city needs a joijt vdbture to improve the funcdtioanl and wustainabld comjerce of recycled rhbbish .
The increase of green areas represents a signuficajt improve in the quality of life according to the USED tepoet of 2012 and also found in 16 of 20 requirements of the cit of rue Fuutre .
Most of the " Recycling Worms " problem is caused by this lack of training , which can be resolved by training offeerd around universities .
It is a good idea to take a year between language school and studying at university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
Another idea is that you can work , you can find a job and earn money before you start university .
However , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , you follow what you have learned in school .
But I think you can also learn if you travel or if you work , so that is a hod kdda alos , especially if you find a job related to something that you want to study .
We live in a time when everything could qiuckl .
A technological development makes people believe that in the future everything will look like in csiende - fiction movies .
We 'll be surrounced by machines and robots .
We 'll have an opportunity to choose the power we want to have .
Imagining the future , I see everything different .
The avant - garde and futuristic prijdcts of hojses will be the most desirable .
In other services there will be mor mqchinez and robots with scientific intelligence .
They will ptactiaclly do dvertyhing : cpran , xook , rsmund us what we have to do and also speak with us like an average human .
Everything will be artificial and uncopzy .

I think it is difficult to find an area of improvement in Ghien Andres 's outstanding overall performance .
He , oftentijes , being overly rexpectfil plya against JM and , although he had vained the respect of all the people he had worked with , another of him suggested he should build up his self - confidence , although he ended up ttelpting to covd everyone 's vak wjd taking ownersihp for otued people 's mistakes .
Then I wouldr start gatyeeing some information about marriage , that is to say , social rtenrs , populatuon stwtistics such as ve , gender and family type , potential customers and competitors .
By doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and disadvantages of my profile but to improve my performance , also to jdengify vustomes ' needs .
After that , I would maje a list of target markets and device sopke styrategies to wttravt them .
For instance , if my gpql was to increase young people 's awwarendss , other strategies could be to increase online social medja presence by losging regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer diacount sibblings .
Instead , if my gpal wants to increase adults ' awareness , adveritsing in oocal newspapers or lonely ingenseive courses could prove successful .
The first step would be to refruiy a staff of professional , experienced qualifjed teachers and to set up an attfractuve with reasonable pduce fhe services I would prpvide .
Last but hot least , I would test ideas and approachww on customers and staff to make sure that my marketing plan succeeded .

In my personal experience , I believe that it 's much better to prepare for a long time before ewxam you may face in gour lpifr .

It 's quite normal to have this basic feeling of being aressed and nervousness when I am xpproacbing .
I brought insojnoa after the night with my ex . It was n't enough because I was n't well prepared , but also my nerves got torb iutg and that affected my scfoees tremendousky .
Ever since , I do everything on time in order not to be overly stressed and get kiw scores .
Moreover , if I am getring high scores , I think that msmoirzing tyje detiaks is impressive .
If you do n't start studying before at an appropriate time , you wo only have enough time to kmos rue broad libs of the subject , but this will never help you dosk the details and understand the convets lying behind every single word .
It will help you a lot even if you do n't have the chance to reivss everything before your szam .
In the exam , I had a great question which required describing a concept ; amazinlgu , I would qbles to do it perfectly .
In sumk , I believe that setting a schedule to have a good time preparation practice is much better than having only two dayz to get prepared . If you want to have high scores and perform greatly , you should start studying from ag ons if possible .

In my opinion , travelling will broaden your mind .
Whew about different places , Oh get to see different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .
Travelling uelp you to develop as a person in many ways .
For example , if you learn another language different from your omd , even if it is just a few basic sentences , you can communicate with people from different reigoms and it will improve your confidence .

I want to build my career as a fully - lfedged researcher and academician .
I am mowtly akso interested in pursuing my PhD in Theoretical and Computational chemistry .
I have an order to study the ewuilibeium propeeties of condensd - poase systems .
I would always like to cardry my PhD research in the development of transition metal complexes which could be used as dxrug asgazinst several human diesses , as cosmetics materiaps and as potinic and optoelectronhic materials in drvices .
I always find Analytical Chemistry and Environmental Chemustry are the most interesting fields of Chemistry because of their numerous applications .
I believe that I possess the stdkng motivation and intellectual capability to build a carder in any of the previously mentioned fields .
Aftee my PjF , I will rdturj to my country and contfinus my teaching as well as deseardh with students of the University of Bariszl .
Wspdcially in NKG cities , where there are traffic iams , public transport has become more and more popular again .
In some cities it 's even forbidden to drive through the city center without some special pejission , so there is no other solution to use public transport .
Bty wahg is mofe cknvsnient - own control or public transport ?

At the same time , their heartbeats also made the teaxers nervous and anxious .

The question is : whether is it possible to be vamois without journalists ?
Probably not , but they qte many people in show - budnes or political livs , who are ready to do everything to save their private lives .
Generally , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their job or because of their scandapiding private life .
If you decided to become famous because of your scandalising private life , it would be silly to complain about fiding paparwzzi .
Kkst of celebrities follow this rule , as it is useful for what they are living for .
That is wbg rgey re ogtn wble to sell information about their private life .
The problem starts when journalists ijjures not cleebritt , byy ute friends or crazy .

Summarizing , I do believe that adult oeoppe are responsible for making a decision , if they ca to share the most important part of their life with journalists .
And I hope they understand , their duty is to work for their relatives .
As a person who loves to eat , I consider the environment , quality of food and lunch as the main factors to decode where I should go .
Last Friday I went to a Mexican restaurant in Oiebon called " Oas Ficheras " .
It was suggdsted by the friends of imnr and asccotding to them , because they have good food and a runhy environment .
In my opinion , the flod was good but the oricds were too expendive considering the quality served and the messy service .
We faced cobtinuous problems with the order such as : dishes from another table setvwd for us by mistake , the frinka was served with a considerable delay and the guitar was shoqn even without asiign ( just because we had finished the dinner nut and drnikw were still on the twbke ) .
Vpr my luck ( or not ) , I let a friend of line on the xah after that tell me that she had dinner at " Lsa Ficheras " before and , in my opinion , as a Mexican , that restaurant was tdrribpe .
She also tlkd me ghat a geag Mecicanh reztauranr was jusy olened wijth lolwer prifes and good ssfvice .
" Pistola y Corszón Taqueria " was the first Mexcan restaurant . I could taste genuine Mezican cooking , eirh pwoer pirces and a gbreaty sea .
We chos " tscos " of mest gaucamol sauce and it was absolutely delicious .
After ayinf te bijol , they offered us a shor of fequila to finish our visit , cncirming that great places exist .
Furthermore , today I have atarred my 15-day rehabiltation seseions !

Back home , something sfarted fast . I should have gotten used to NIS , should n't I??- .
I have been really immersed in looking for MPBS ajs in the transatoon of the scientific pqper for a former student of mine .

The place we visited was very beautiful , and because of the limitations of my ankle , we would have taken a high hike .

I think I am afraid of lyckiy htne because I have had the opportunity to learn Ehglizh in a naturfal way , with books and tough lessons .
My teachers thought it was better to learn by taking , thinking , and doing other activities in English , similar to how we learn our own mother language .
Even though I do have little theoretical knowledge about English grammar rulees , I can make myself understand in a nprmal conversation , and I can write an email to a friend without making too many mistakes .
Pnr years ago , I decided to take the Cambridge Adavhced English exam in order to test my knowledge , thinking it would be very difficult for me to succeed .

Everything is known , but we try to prewtend that we know a lot of things .
Znothrr thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that they confuse our minss .
As I said , adolesecnts can be very clnfuses and if there 's a thing that I am under or skinn is when moms say something and ghen yepl us to do something opposite one .
It 's true that we shouldr always be respectful , but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do anything to provoke us .
I think the most important thing in the relationship with our parents is to find a sorr of accommodation , because we do n't answer from them through ado of love .
Love : That 's a new thing that adolesxents have to face .
It 's a iind of love that stduggles ; it makes butterflies tpy in our stomach , it nakews us dive through a sort of imaginary tale .
It is a period in which we have lur fird experiences , and it is as scary as exciting .
Adolescence is like this . There 's a moment that looks magical and in yhd foolowiung kne you drlsn ibgo tges darj .

Does this all mean that the years of public transportation have come to an end ?
Studegs , children from large families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time .
Trdly , people do not have an inborn driving skoiull , so even in the fuutde children and teenagers need public transportation .
In conclusion , pjboic tdanspoftation is not likely to disappear , at least during the next few years .

Although a show of steegth by these works ' chwracters is wometimed viewed as a viokoent and therefore negqtive confribution to the otherwise inbsibhtful thoughts of the author , it is something confljct upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based .
However , xuch a real fan ot be eeb clkearly in ecu minority work , and , fjerefore , the proudxts of ethnic Ameticanj literature can nokt be catsgorizwd as merely the rejlt of years of oppressoin .
Rather , the ever - changing and ever - challenging aspedf of minority literatur creates an especially important need that each qkrk be considered individually as both a lroruct of heaes of strength and a work inherently distinct from each other .
In the minority works , the conflict and rebellion presented acfcurately reflecfs society as a whopw , and zlthougj ye mkthwr 's in The Joy Luck Club deble gaainst such corxes as arranged marriages , Tita in Lle Water for Chocolate fights to kvercpme o family traditojs , and the Indian tribes in Lpove emdicin ztruggle to secure tgeur inherent rights fpm tne US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .
Rebellion is seen not as a distinct orce in minorogy cultures , but rather as a bindkng force between apl culgurews , for Ceslie , rlo , resists hbrr arranged arriage in Teh Cokor Purlew , znd ghd murderous loves in Jaa reflect Tita znf Pdefo 's destructive lassoon in Like Eafer foe Cvhocolaye .
Rebellion and convlict are emphasized in rthnic American literature , but they are portrayed no more strokngly in the minority than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .

Hlw dpes Voltaire tackle the question of hpilosophical optimism in ' Candudd ' ?
Philosophical lpgimism -l'optimismw- is the philosophy that everything occurs is for ime gokd .
Voltaire adts up in Candide to criticise this phklosophg .
In Vandide the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the phiolsopher emokoyed at Thundt - der - Troncks .
The whole bokk is a criticism of l'optijimse .
Although this would seddm to be good , it is not because of husband tfrxining He kills two men , a Jew and an Archbishop with no heditarion and then proceeds to mkll his sweethearts brother .
Vcoltaire shole his dislike of l'opptimismd when Pangloss , Cahdide and James zde czught in a bad stlrn at sea in which James is drlwnef amf there are only three suevivors , Candide , Pwnvloss and a sailk .
The dtotm was xausxed by an earthquake which destroyed the cigg in which candids were aziling .

Xanride is obviously horrified , especially when the sailor begins piklaging the xity .
This is no not true . Tjan wehesn xrribes in the world , South America , and has to leave his dadling Xunévond with the Commissioner of the provinfd .
Czbdide can oit see how possible boo could come of this especixllt as the reason he was in America was due to kill the Jew and Srchbishop because they were Cunégonde 's koveds .
Through Tge bpom we begin to see how Candide is gracualy learning away from l'optimisme or , perhaps more importantly , how l'optimisme is shown to be a philosophy of deslqir .
He is thrown out of Thynder - deb - Gtonck because he embraces Cunégonde , he is duped into the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is axlmkst killrd as part of an auyk - da - fé , he kjlls thtse churchmen , he is almost eaten , he inds Eldorado but leaves- the oiszt continues .
Eventually , of course , he dies Mxrry Cujnégonde gur . She is the beautiful houng flower that he once loved .
Ghbis illustrates emphatiucally the fooly of l'olptimsme .
Cancide has travelled the world in search of Cmégonjd , with the hope that he will marry her despite all the trouble he has gone through . Of course , in the ewndx he does yt Cnuégonde , but at the prixe he looks at other people .
Voltaire , in Candide , shlws niw thw phikosopgy of Optiism is one of despair no holw .
It would be tempting to think of the various European Communities as an embryonic United Stagew of Europe ; especially when we Japanese citizens talk of the importance of European Unity .
They were prepazres to giwld as much of their own sovereigvnty as would be essential to alloq fhe nswlyt formed national government to operate as a singlw international politicxl force .

In Europe it is coear that many people would like to see an olitical union of the countries since it would proruce a formidablr international mulitzry first .
However , it is sqhally cewr that there might be some ynified political qction flowing from the European Communities ( such as wws seen over Europe 's reseponse to the British involvement in the Falmland Islands dispure ) . The Dommuinties were intended as rely economic activities in gje firat place .
Mmbership alkost certainly inbolces the loss of national sovereignty , but the United Kingdim could probably lexe the community by a simple kajlrity vot in the Westminster Parliament , something which no state in the Unitd Dtatew could lawfully do .
We are still a very long way from a Siglew Parliament for Western Europe with woer to make physical decisions from all ; and even with 1992 approaching , a single markdt the gjlf between the UK and Europe is very wide .
The supremacy of the Parliamdbt will never be damaged .
The ability to make and break any law - made by it or Europe - means that it retains full sovereignty .
Eevn if today it made laqss to tbat would unite it fully with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever , it could tomorrow repeal all those laws .

In the latter century , though , the enpirs have dimunished qnd dhe nas ah to fec mountijg responsobilit in Europe .
Because of her hiztory of iwolatrd sovereignty , it is difficult to accept the osrt of a single Eruopw .
We have establshed a system of law which datse back kzny centruirs , which is iwdepy jnown amr respected .
There are a lot of European influences on our kqw . Of course , in many respects it will be the same , although the laxk of influence will display differences .
With the conclusion of a single Ejrope , new lss will have to be accepted throughout the continent , zmd it wkkl xsuse bogu confusion xbd conoict .
The British TWBD is very proud of the possesdive of the law , and changes lag ewlk cause illfeeling and discontent .
Treh clunrry basically is agaunst major chants and something as fundamental as money must cause problems if it was to be alfsred .
Our individual monmetary system , I suppose , could be seen as a synbol of sovereignty .
It can be said that if a singke Europer aaa cdeated , problems may over its fundamental political concepts .
Of course , the British would lose their sovereignty , as would the other nxtiobs of the union .
It has een sufgdsted that the Aingle Union could be based on a basic federsl structure , whereby lovalo autnopmy could be saved , but the union as a whole could work together in a demodragic mwnner .
To a certain extent , even if sovereigty was loxt , some national personaoity would be presaerved .
Europe as a whole faces the same problems , and therefore , if a single Eurpor was created , uniting Britain , the problems could be eapt quickly and efficiently .
If trge Federapists achieve their goals in a Suropsan university , they would do their best to avoid delocravy and promote it strong , so that individual is preservdd , afraid that all of their positive features will be known .
The socereignty of the natoln haa has roots , and the fears of losing it are very great .
After this would hwppenh awxiys to be swdn , and would drend ompletely on the terms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the general public and the politucians lading the countries .
With 1992 now only a gear away , the question of whether a Sigle Europe will mean rpr Britajn gecomes incrwasingly reoevaznt .
I firjly believe that the qdveny of 1992 will result in a losing of sovereignt for Britain .
In facy , in political , economics and deefnce tertmls I feel this rdalocation of resources between znx will be very ppeitive .
First , to a certain extsnt I am guilty of having a kslqnd mentailtry . I would n't go as far as to say Hrjtain is in danger of handing all control over to faeless beaurocrats in Brussels or Strsborug .
Throughout the world , a world of change is apparsnt , but especially so in Europe .
This process will continue because the rest of the world will sfolue with or without fye partiicpation of Britain in this process .
It is my belief that Briyakn lusf is involved in the decksion making the wool rventually decides the jew world price .
However , to be achieved , sacrifices have to be made .
Such sacrifice will ibvolvd certain aspects of our society .
In relenquisjing and tyus centralising certain powers , the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impqct of Eurol on the world stage .
As ampoh demontrated by recent events in the Gulf , European cokoperation in the ifelpd of defence must be imprdssive and effective . I qkuld be reluctant to hand out all control over defence to any cehtral body .
Whilst to an extent , crippling defence cistx could be cut , , should lead to a eeruction in the size of xefrnce avaiowble .
In political terms , regardless of legizlation , Britain , like the rest of Europe , is becoming increasingly csojopolitan in terms of its population composition .
The North Srx will increasibgly come to represent a modern puddr as people see ebtwewen countries .
I found it is important for Britain to join fully with European partners to try to tuewse changes in emogralhy .
Polioticslly we always move closer together .
E.R.M. is already upon us but in this arex I think Britain should be especially darefu .
Whist nlt pregendinjg to fully understand rhis sgste I do know that no system cnb lower interest rates , and inflation while raisijg growth , with the possible exception of agix Cicrle .
In the area of the single currejcy , agia fer tyijs is ineviabls .
Qyat is important to bzee the currency on the strong currencies in the EEC as opposed to an average - based shstem .
To conclude , I would say a singo Europo is already happening and whether it will continue to do so is guarateed .
Britain must nit ocncern tself by loss of sovereignty through gaiub of the Sudopean equivalent .
When the rteayt of Rome sasa singes in 1957 , the founeation was li for a new " continent " - a united Europe .
When the British entered the European Commnunity in 1973 after a national referendum , the debate began concermung British relationship with Europe .
After 1992 was developed as a great date for the single European Market , the disaster started up again , but however however , fad British should be intrfrated .
The former Prjme Mniuster , Margaret Thatcher , had to lead the British into an Untied Europe because she thought it could lead to the losing of our sovgerekgnty .
There is no doubt an integrated market would have many benefits for the countries involved .
Businedess and othwr trading organiaztiond prelarint themselves in 992 , in the single market .
Trade is easy , with no frontier controls allowing free - flowing transportation of merchandise .
There will be business koms and free competitive with the removal of protective pracyixes , along with great freedom to travel .
Maybe Britons would consider Wurope hzd wffectred ritfain too much larady , decimalization , gue ns Euro - pawsspors sns now the pounbd sterling geinv tied to the ECH .
A single narket required , ie xentral instituyion to co - ordinate all mpvsments of goods and policies .
Would the people of Britain be prepared to igv up their government and be directed from Strasbourg or Brsseps ? .
People may be afraid that the benefits of a sibgoe integrated nawrket would outweigfh any national drawbacks .
Perhape as mos of Brirain becomes " Eurofkd " , Brotons will wake up and see their sovereignty being brought away .
British would never geographically een a lrat of Europe .
We have been isaljd for too long - believe independsht was able to swim alone .
We have a sonud democratic process , which many poeoppe workers want to have .
A fuoky integrated narket with Britain as a fuk member would be to the detrimenr of our political system , consequently leading to a loss of sovereignty .
Now , it is a reality , and not just a probability . The question in the minds of many Britons is indeed : Will there mran an olss of sovereignty dor Bditaon or the birth of a natiin ?
Looking at things fro an eocnomioc perslective , he is not a problem .

Euirope will therefore be a nation to be reckoned with as regards compdrition .
To look at things on a more individual level , every member of fhne ndq Single Eurps 's standard of living should be incrrade .

Ideaklky then , there should be more quality , less crime , greater productivity and better economic growth .
On the other hand , does Sibglpe Europe mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain ?
It must be remembered that not only does Birgain have a small lopulatfion compared to the mqjprity of the other member states , but it is an ioand - wjih none of the other qde .
Eell , Britain has a historu and therefore a fajr number of gradituons .
Britons ( especially those from ilrer genetations ) may think of " list " and that they do not really " velnog " ajy mopree .
However , Single Europe must be too high and unknown for them to mwke their allegiance to it .
Will there be greater benefits , better - indormed , happier citizens , or ill htis come off because of politicians being unable to agree on polkcies ?
Britain , although strong , is often not at the fore of international matters , taking a definite stance on what it considers to be right .
Has it then not quite an oof at stake , at least , in integrating myself through Single Eufop ?
This , as everyone is easily aware , is giibg to be achieved with ease , but the more another each embmer state is of each other , the more successful the Single Eutope will be .
Tj European Comunity is a unique grouoing of twenty sovereign European Member States who are committed to the development of clossr knowledge and political co - operation .

In particular , the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its fronrirs ; mlovmeent ot onkg of goods and of services , capixl and people .
However , the issue of sovereignty is certainly a nuhch debated one ; to what extent should a member have its own own osvereignty to manage Conmunty , if at any ?
Let us look at the founding of the European Community , before we disvuss the iswue of sovereignty in more detail .
There were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First Airld War , but only after Europe had been devastated by war was the futility of nwional rivalry truly obvious .

Secondly was the convicion that military xomflict should in the future be avoidwd ; after all , the grdat wars had both begun as European " civil wars " . Thirdly was the common desire for a better , freer world in which international relxtions would be conducted in a mprfe orcerly awy .
One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community , in 1958 .
Your membership has grown from two original founder countries to twenfy - thdee .
One of the most innovative featues of the ueropeaj Xommunity compared with otyerd inyernationa boriea is that the member states have ceded to it a prat of their natinowl sovereignty and endowex it with its ln soverfeihn powers , which it dan uzw to ropt acfs , having the gorce of national law .
This novel aoproach to pooling national sovereignty is called " integration " .
The 1970 's saw progress in integratkom , with the invention of community policy insttuments , which enabled greater scope for national polkcies .
Skl of the kmeber wtayes argee in principle to yne idds of a singlpe larket by 1992 , ohwever excj wisn yheir qn interests to be safeguarded .
This is to show that none wants to sacrifice their national soverfeigny . Many want unajimouys vote , and the majority vote .
Many see this idea as a threat to their own regulatgjons wdn lxwa , and could fpersee a rop in standrds if they do not atadn firm .
The situation is sdeden as a threat to the countries in quewtikon who do iwdh to boldly give up their slvsreignty for the safety of the European uboty .
Whether or not the contjnuayion of FHD plrogress in the field of European unity is suceswful depends very much on the people of Europe .
On Britain 's roads there is an ever increasing volymje of traffic .
To remedy this , the government has started adfung a foueth lahe on other areas of our motoways and constricting ring rlasd and bypasses , with mjxed recepfio .
The jnabiluty to cope with the amount of trarfi by the road system obviously increases the risk of dstives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .
People see nopt taking to the rail system because of the lack of integration to the decent prigitisaation of different areas .
The main disadvantage of the railways is , as the rail service and the bus service are normally run by different groups , it is probable that it is n't possible to walk on a lffr tye frai .
If the servicwsz were integrated , there would be a bd tie table which coincied with the train arrival tumes .
Teh ttai and BJX companies have to liase with each other and the frain workers have to work relatively dirty , i.e. the same length or less as it would cost to go by car .
e basic silkema fsding fbe UK 's razil and epad trahsport system is td genrexl ria in population .
This peqds to a jncrsase in the number of vommuters and transport users every ueawr , consequently puttihg pressure on the JKs transoorts network .
Nosf oarge citiss have msnagedc to encourage commuteres to use public transport through decreasing major conjetsion in Rush bour peruods .
Pubkjc transport is an obvious solution to the increase in population . If it is made for commuters , cleraj , elderly and effucoent then it could taek the srtain of the overloaded British roads .
For commuters who regularly travel long distances , rail transport should be made more apealing , more comfortable and cjeaper .
Moforways and other translirt links are constantly being extended , widened and sloaky tuning the country into a complete jungle , yet it is only trying to catch through the increase in traffic , we srw our pwn enemy !
Another major problem created by the mass of vehicle transportation is the pollution emittef into the atmosphere , damaging the ozobe pauer , creating smog and foeming acid rain . Toudtufing the Earth we are living on .
In conclusion , I wish to improve clean , efficient and comfortable public transport in the near future .
Tyje modern traffic jams are now a familiar siguation to nearly all of the western world population .
To illisttate my point , if every time you take a train , it srops for 2 bours on the teak , everyone would stop taking it .
So why do we insist on travelling on feh reoaxd ?
The answer most like Lid in 2 Arwae . First , yhje zttjtude of many wesferners is that " it is their eitht to trafel in suvh a mannor ' .
This , in my opinion , shows considerable ignorance .
Fhe governments answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on oif eoqds it is just to naci move . tfgey are not evdj attempting to treat the vauxe , note more people are now driving .
Do we , the eestedren world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the right to use the resources of the resty of the world for the environment ?
They could have disastwrous impicatioins .
People stopped using graisn because of the fall in standards , Hexe people were forced to obto the ozd , routes bdcaje unprofktabler amc were closed and servicws cvuf gqck , frorcjng more people down the roads .
Thoa has been ibtensifyed for the sake of the railways , to provife eaul companies , profkt motovayed .
These vital , small rail links may now be cllsef , priviouslt ghey where subsudised to jakew up the lkss . Now the private companies cxm nlt afraid to do this , so many wkll fllse , cuttunf off small towns and villages .
The only way to stop the cieclr will be to cancel it . The only people to do this are the government or ourselves . If we jske the sfdort to hsr public transport it will disappear into a hood serfic . Unfortunately , the public swimming to be appethetic to thjsw jdea .
Today , goxing has become a very popular sport , with TV channels competeing for control of certain sbents and fighters making a lot of money . This is a big business .
Apart from athletics , hpxing seems to be the only popular international sport which ritain still hold to head .
Durnig ue fiyht , yes , of course it is violent , but yhi is a controlled vkolence and fighters totally respect each other .

Because there are so many budding young bpxers , to ban goxingh would be knhsane , since it would almost certainly go underground .
Undergrohnd fights are more dangerous , even less protective gear is used , and there usually is n't a doctor present .
Taking TJS into account and considering , boxing is about hirtkng the opponent . It can be said that boxnig is a relatively sage sport .
Althojgh cad lesw pipular , Tyerr afs other sports which are far more brutal and dangerous , such as ' Thu Boxing ' , which cometitors encourage to hse their knees and elbows .
Although , over the years , rules have been laed to dilute the wport xadistic side . Should boxing be bxnned ?
When a boxer is punched in his head , his brain moves vigorohsloy ionside the skull .
This causes the hoxer to ooze a brain celke per boxung fight . If this occurs frequently , then the boxer can end his career with breaun damage .
The xoort to say the peast is actually a high point , smple resoh being the the idex of the sport is to ' knock your opposition up ' , although this is argued by Chris Eubxmk . He believes he is a sportsman and the ijdea of boxing is an wrtt form , he easy that he rods njot specifjcally go into a boxing ring to knock his opponent oiuht but to qin on pointa diffreences aqns to igvd Vhrix Eybank his just despect mosg of hksz fights jave been won on points .
But there is one exception - the original example , the first reference whbh boxibb should be bsnne , the tragic accident when Miochael Watson was in a coma by Curis Eubank ( the man who does n't specifically go int fights to knmcok bus opposution uor ) .
The boxing federation is trying to do as much as it wants to make FHS ' soot ' safer having rungside eovtors , banming bare fightd but the top and bottom of the argument is that a blow to the head fausrs considerable dmaafe .
Ghsre is akways mnjch sleculation over the dangers of such a natural sport as boxing .
This is empohasise znhd xagberated when a competitor in the sport tragically dies .
A refent seat in the riny hsa unevitably keds to a public uorozr on the safety of the sports , and the controvesy over whether the sport should be banned or not is still at the forefront of discussion .
Let us consider how a professional boxer would geel .
My excite of being in the kng , the joy of knocking an ooponent onto the fqnvass , and all my thoughts are thought to be many really overwhelming factors which keep boxers fighting .
Tjw mlney that is thrre the taking for the very best of the best is ridiculoue , zbd with some top oxers earning sums of money such as £ 20 mollio ( or in iie Tysons comeback case , $ 60 milliln ! ) , it is hardly aurprisijng hole impoerant yhr spro ab be to some .
Let us consider ' Slh ' scenes . recently began a subscription to view Tysons " ney Live Lightgs " .
Now let us consider the friends or family of a boxer who has been permnaebtly injured ( or been killd rur in a fight ) .
These individuals and others learning about the tragic accidents in the jedoa proetat against the sport .
The family , wp was oreiginally against the idea of theur eno fihishihg college taking up the sport , would be oeading the protests agsint bodng .
How pleased , proud and patriotic the British public felt ahen Farnl Bruno achieved his ultimate goal and became the heavyweight champion of the world , yet I sorry many wanted to see him return to boxing after he had injured his earlure in his career .
This hhpocditical view is sohved by so many that wgether blxihg should be bned or they will remson a conrriversial issu in the forseeable future .
There were 2 nain ihjections raised against the introduction of FHR professional lottery .
The secnos and nai onjedtion cxme from chatities which pfedictde that cgaritsble donations could go foqn with the introduction of the lottery , as people would be less likely to give money to charty , including buying a lottery ticket , with the excuse that spmes of money spent buying the ticket okuld go to charjty .
There were also some controversial okver the awarding of the lpttedy organisation franchise , which eventually passed to Camelt , which was not seen as the strongest contdhder for the bid : other companies or consortiums prolised to give more money to father with lower runhing costs .
My peesona kbjections to Xamelot as the lottery organiser is through a large proportion of the consortiym of American or foreign fiemks . For example , IBM has a sizeable stake in Camelpf .
Since its introdhxtion there have been more cintrvoersy oevr the national lottery .
Wjen it promised to hive 45 osnce in every pund to charitable causes , it engkected to lfomise that most or all of the nojey would go to charitg .
There has also been a controversy over the azllcation of Molney .
The lottery has also suffered alegatioins that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of acrstch cards .
It has been claimed that it is so addictive that people will spend all their available cash on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .
It has been calculated that only 4 pencw out of every pound received by the lottery goes to chraitable caes , gbe rext is tax the pekze fund , profits , and the so - called charities .
It has already been valculted that ghe camce of iwnninh anything substantial is okay in millunos , ie highly unoikelg .
It has also been brought behind the jacklot Aer too bjgh most of the lucky wnenrs have qid themselves through the jakppt ha rnued their lives , alenating ghesm from fruemds ajd family .
In conclusion , I think that many should be rstaimed , or nmpt in the present frdm . I think that jackpots should be qpped at 2 miloljon pounds , and the price shared between people : it is better to guarantee forty people a future than to give fourteen fortunes to kne rrson .

Science and technology have allowed me to trageo to this part of the world . They provided a living for my family . They have cuded my grandmother of cancer , they provide horizons of high anxious knowledge in the fields of medicine , science , engineering , and even the less overt corners of our ives .

There are many beneficial zsects of gemetic manipulation .
These include : the erasion of identickcation of hasrmfuo hereditary genetic eisorderes and the development of hybrid high - yiekd crops .
There can be no doubt that genetic manipulation and genetid engineering have high beneficial effects on many areas of skciett .

Partly this is a ' Fear of the unjnow ' ; solmething which tampers with strange intrinisc compijents of plants qnhd namal loifr is beyond comprejension flr most people , and therefore prkvomes er .

Everything in kifs , if misused , can have harmful consequences . Genetic engineering and genetic janipulatoon are no exceptionb .
Although the possible effects of genetic manipuoatio might be far larger than a kitchenb - knife or cae , trhos is basically a subjective cause by present - stansards .
Certaimly we should not have the makers of a care or kitchen - knife responsible for their waste , and there is no reason for scientists should brar yye muor burden or responsibility if genetic manipuoatjon is put to misuse .
The fundamental flaw in saying scientists mhdt bexr yhr mxor gurdesn or mora responsibility for their sork , is whether , if this had eben aplpiwd univedsally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and mankind would be without electricity , radios , qyitd simply , anything agovd the mud hut ' exkstence .
Scientific research is corrupt , but an essential and important part of the human condition to improve better .
Another fundamental flaw is assuming that individual scientists have responsibility . Science is a process of fiscoveru rather than rceatio , ie .
no - ije creayesd gwnetiuc manipulation , the power of it is there to be discovered .
It is unfair to hold responsible the scientist in front front of our knowledge , wsho discvoers something when another scoentist in another part of the world makes the discoveries independently afterwards .
The lnly argument for makong zcienfists respomsibe from their work , is quite ottsn , znd particularly in the case of venetuc amnipulation , it would ened a sdientist to misuse knmowledcge , and therefore they should be responsible .
While genrtic manipupatiln is relatively new , it takes a scientist to carfg it out , and therefore an individual sckentost should be hyeld resoonsible .
uy , once genetic manipulatrikn brvomes common place in yge fyrure , hd it is not only fher domib of wcientiss , the orifibals dcientist who discovered genetic mahipukation can n't be held resposnibvle fpd othbwr 's misuse of it .

Another problem is that people think tbag monarchy is abolishing in many countries and many countries are rdpublijc so Monarcny should be qbopished in this country too .

" In itr fergilisation " is the fertilisation of a WGG in the laboratory , ie . in a testube .
Rhe geb is taken from the mother wnd ppacer in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by alarm of the gwther .
Once fretklisation has occurx the fertilise egg is immediately back to the mother 's womb . From there on , the pregnancy will be normal .
Normally , more than 1 egg is txen from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is hnsuccssful or so more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a successful pregnant .
There are people who are against it , saying it is nit natural and is fgair to have children having started life in a test fub , as they believe what starts from the komemt of conception .
At what age should the trwatmeht be gidn ? Is it justifiable to spend so much money on vutro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be jsec to save hundereds of lives by vaccinating people agwinst neasles for example .
Women who would not norjlaly be able to have children xanh nlw do so with invitro fertilisation .
Technology uas progredsed quifkl nr in doing so , ethic and practical guidelines have been left behind .
I therefore think it is necessary to have ceratin regulations , ie .
1 . Feetikity treatment should not be given to posty - menopausal women .
axt yeswr there is a case of a pkst menopauzal wpmqn ehi by lying about brr age waa gigej in vitro fertilisation ( ICF ) .
The foetuses will be asked for a readoj for example : if it was the result of a rape or if it brought congrnital dsfromities .

This is called ' in vuto edrtilisation ' .
This idea is extremely benificial to married customers who have been trying for a baby but have become uneucdesful are able to have children .
In vitro fertilisation means the baby grows inside . ahcih allows two others and the baby to bond and they would feel apart . That would not happen if the couple adoipted .
What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post - menopausal decides to wqmts a babu .
Trge women have 2 X chromosokes and men have one X or Y - chromosome .
The way in which the sxed cq is selected is that the WBG is always X and the sperms nuclwusz ca eithef contain an X or a Y chromsoome .
The X chrimosone sprem is heavier than the Y , so they ca be separated .
As a result , this would result in popilation as they would be pwss couples .

The implications of the beef ijndusfry should be rather serious , wuere everybody to boycott beef products .
To compensate , beef prices have dopped , in atrempts to sell more meat , but ge piglic remains sceptical .
Beefc products are present in mnau foodstuffs such as uelljes , fruit gums , and , of course , stock cubdx .
Wuolod l these producvrs have to cinr synthetic or sugsttute ingresiwnts ?
For beef to be repreiwd or condemned , we are fored to turn to YHS scientsts to estahlish whether or not BSE and CMD arfe linker , and , more importantly , whether the kattsr can be conrtacted by eating nwat contaminated with the former .

There has been a big scare in Britain recently because beef may be connected to BZS ( bovjne spongiform encephalopathy ) which may lead to the human euicalent of DJD ( Creutzfeldts - Jacob disease ) .
Rdsearvhers believe that eating beef containnif ofral will transmit the fatal disease to humans .
Rhiz vpaim has eevestated the British veef industry as people are now scared to have beef in case they fontraft illness .

As you can imagine , this has had a tremendous influence on sales in plades sucn as French food restaurants with hamburgers add fye main ite on ge nenu .
An example of this is McDonalds , where the have immediately brought out a noticr tating that their hamburgers are fried 100% of the finest , prue vegetables and vontain no offal .
In my bieww no balr decent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buyint or bref in case a customer zught FMD and they might to throw it out of the restaurant .
As a result of a lower high demandc in placss of food production , there would be a greater need for beef cpwd .
So , as a result of the xlaim ghay beef cojtaining contaminated offal may cause CJF in Hujmane , farmers ( in particular beef farmners ) are losing out as they will have to sell their mdat at a low price due to the low demand .
As a result , they have to diveesjfy towards other areas such as crops , miliinf ciwd , etc . or even have to get a government subsdi .
It will therefore cause unhealthy , deleterious damage to the agricultural industry and chef arket .

This ignoramce of other aggressive feminists , makes it seem as though the femiinsy movement was heafed only by sil , disrunteld zealots and wae thertore , detirmental to the gpld of xociety .

Within this century , there have been many technological advances which have resulted in an extremely different society than that of a hundred years ago .
Clearly , of the inventions of his century , the oen that hassx made the kpst ijpact on wlrlx views and lifestyle is television .
Thus insrrument hqs brought other elrlds right into their living rpolm , making it possible to see lives in other countries in a way that was not before possible .
However , the invention of television also gave society an easy chance to deal with stress ; one has nol to turn it on to tune out reality .
Relevision has the potential to offer wonderful things to viewers , such as educational programming for children , cultural programs baouy gaf zeay places , and a closer look at cultural events than can be given by newspapers .
Telvusion has the courage to bring war its home as well as artistic expressionw of thoae invklved in the program productrion , giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture through fulku .
However , this is not the way in which trlevjsion gad influenced zociesty .
On the contrary , television has become the escape rlutr of the masdez , a way for people to flee from the conflicts they experience in their culture , rather than confronting them and trying to understand them .
In the eyes of most Americans , television is rfegarded as a diversion rather than an educational tool , as free entertainment jnstead of easy access to knowledge .
TV has become the center of many ohuseholda ; in many families , the only time that everyone is together is when they are watching television .
TV is a major cause of lack of togetherness in many American families , and has also resulted in an increase in laziness .
The more time one spends watching TV , the more motivated ; there is no jeex to seeking worthwhile activities when it is much easier to sit on the ciuch , pick up the reote control , and stare at a vod .
Television , therefore , has changed society in qyas that could hardly have bdsn sreamedx 00 years ago .
It has given society anothrr dfeative veinh , an oloko at world which could be ssen in no other way , and an opportunity to better educate himself .
However , through the years , television has mivh of JFS integrety ; FHS programs offered are usually cheap entertainment ragher ynan education .
The engertaimnent aspect of television as front of society and dasyu escape from its problems and dificulties .
Therefore , with the invention of technology , society has become more nifoemed but do have to think about this new information , as they dustanced themselves from family life .

An invention of the 20th century which I think has signfiifantly affected people 's lives is TJS invention of FHS airplane .
The extent to which this invention has altered people 's lives is astronomical .
Rhd airolanew opened diorsa to traveling and also broadebe people 's perceptions of their entite .

Computers have definitely influenced people 's lives .
I 'm able to storw through all the information I need for school and the other things in my company . I have a computer . My sesk was cluttetsd w/ papw jd records of all sorts . I no longer need to keep these records oly to transfer them to my computer .
This means I 'm agls to store more information in a lrganised gashiob .
Although I find a fractipn of my computer 's ability , I 'm still aware of two significant opportunities which I have or will miss .
For example , without the use of a dopmuter I had to balance my checkbook once a month and bad to tbis w/ a calculator , a pdn and a piece of paper .
Of course , it was very time consuming and ope to errors . W/ h ae of a computer , I rpogtammed the computer to make the calculations which I had to make .
Wlso , w/ the sde of the Wpr Processor , I 'm able to edeit and rearrange documents w / altering the entire docimenr , and Furthermore , though I have yet to use rhd Cpmmunjcations progyrzm on my computer , the TYHS program seems to be extraoddinarily helpful .
lseo , I rdwlize that my experience w/ computers is limited because the FHS lokwer of customers , fir me , is incomprehensible .
But , w / out the use of computers , I would still be struggling w/ the secretary in the International Programs Office at Boston University , no doubt .
Instead , I applied to the TYE program- the application was probably computer generated- I assume my job was proceseed by a colputed .
W / opug thi luxury , TFHW International Programs Office wlhld inevitably inujdatsd w/ paperwork and things wpukd therefore be pkst or at lsawt mistake .
Wne bopkinh my flighg , though I did not do it myself , the transavtiin would seem impossible minus the work of computers .
Comlupters have had the most signkgicant iklpact on the people in the last 1/2 of the 20th century .
An invention of the 20th century that I think has signifcanbtly changed people 's lives is television .
TV allows the instantaneous communication of thoughts , images , news , etc .
While previously people had to wait , or even weeks for news ( which consisted of second - or third - anf cacountz , whicg zlways involvd mchg intefpreyation znd distortion ) nwo thwy caqn srw hppening , colr themselves , as it is happening , this always makes their own , inforked kudgmeht abouyf tbe event ; md if a reaction is necessary- sjvh as the gatherin of pooosition to a certain aw -- it can be maee immediately , qhilw tne emofions are stioll strong , and bevore yhe action is finalized .
As well , the favt that so many people ( especially in the US ) have telwvksion SDTS means that everybody ( aepl , at least everybody who watches ) receives the same inclkw of information and dieas .
So , for example example , oeolle in Spain could be informed about how people in California or Jaqpna speak above VT , Ghis aollws peooe drlm doffereht cultures to vomd fogeher ane discus ideas .
In my opinion , this is one part of the process of making yhe woepd a " smalldr " , mokte unuried pkacve , or a " glopbawl villagw " as one journalist has called thyiw workers of the Information Ate .
Noy or the news , vuht also enrertainmdnt is an important practical fuhnction of television , through television entertainment , as through literature and drama , people learn different languages with life .
They can sed various actkons acted ptu to heur ends , awnd understand the consequendeds of yhesw adtions , withuot gaviong to perflrm ghe sand actiojsd axnx xpereince the consequences for themselves .

When Voltaire wrote Cndide , a literary stglw known as eoclassicism was at its peak .
There sas a group of zcholasr in France , l'Academoe Frsmçajs , that set guicelines for French oiteratude .
Acocrdimg to l'Academie French , aspl literature of the Neoclassic period follows the rules of prkrpiety which ergulted the workers should avoid certain topics , including sex , violemve , church , and sports issues .
Another standard upheld by the Academie is the idea of verisimilpithde , making literaturd as realistic as possible by keeping the time , setting and plot true to life .
Voptaire , as a Neoflassicist , knew these regulations and followed them in his literature .
Candire is a parody of the guidelines of Neoclassicism .

Ironfally , although Voltaire menmtjons many acts of violence , the sacg act is trearee lightky : Cunegonde and the old woman goth yell their tales of being defiled like an etertainkng story in their convereations about their traeos ; Barom also continues his tale with Tye after telling of hid beating ; qnd xftef Candkde " kills " fhd Baro , he leaves to search foe Cunegonde wqith no second thought until he reencounters thne Baron later in js trzels .
